# Travelling Salesman Problem: a Genetic Programming solution

## Description

This repo presents three different solutions to the travelling salesman problem:
- A genetic programming solution mainly defined in the introduction of the great book of Julian F. Miller, Cartesian Genetic Programming
- Two solutions based on convex hull detection:
 - A recursive solution defined in `pseudo_tsp.pseudo_tsp`
 - A iterative solution defined in `pseudo_tsp.pseudo_tsp_2`

## Requirements

- python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- tqdm

## Execution

To execute this code simple run:
```
python genetic_programming_TSP.py
```
