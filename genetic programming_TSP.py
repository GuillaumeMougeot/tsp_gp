"""
This code presents a genetic programming approach of the travelling salesman 
problem (TSP).
It is mainly inspired from the introduction of the Julian F. Miller's book:
Cartesian Genetic Programming.

The function descibed in pseudo_TSP are an implementation of a personnal
approach of this problem. They are inspired from convex hull finding. I
then input these solutions, which are not found in O(exp(n)) but less,
into the GP algorithm to see if it can improve the result. Conclusion:
it can for high dimension (number of cities > 30)... I'm not perfect...
